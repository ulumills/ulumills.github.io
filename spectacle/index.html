<h1><strong>An approachable introduction to the cultural arts</strong></h1>

<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>The Challenge</h3>



<p>The cultural arts face financial challenges in many parts of America, and we found that this is also true in Pittsburgh. Not only has there been a steady decline in attendance in recent years, the average patron is in their 40s.</p>



<p>Many people are reluctant to attend due to either false preconceptions about what they’ll experience, or out of hesitation to invest time, money, and coordinative efforts into the unknown. </p>



<p>We sought to help these users take the chance that might lead to a lifelong connection to the arts.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3><strong>The Outcome</strong></h3>



<p>Spectacle is a service that curates personalized package experiences centered around a cultural music event.</p>



<p>It offers dining and entertainment paired with the main event, but the purpose of Spectacle extends beyond convenience–we sought to create a service that would encourage a symbiotic relationship with audiences and cultural arts institutions, so that future programming would be more reflective of the community, thus attracting more new audiences to help sustain them.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<h3><strong>Intangible Value Leads to More Viable Arts Institutes</strong></h3>



<p>By acting as a vendor for arts institutes, Spectacle has an active interest in them more financially profitable. </p>



<p>But the service’s greater value comes by creating a streamlined feedback system with audiences. </p>



<p>By focusing on making this feedback system an essential and enjoyable part of the experience, Spectacle helps to ensure that artistic directors are creating programming that resonates with the community in which they are situated.</p>

</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>More than an app</h3>



<p>Here’s how spectacle works:</p>



<h4>Festival Pop-up</h4>



<p>Potential users would first encounter Spectacle’s member organizations at a pop-up tent at local community festivals. Here, they would get a preview of a tailored evening-long experience that mirrors what they would experience.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group boxes split"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-group box boxl imagebox"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">

</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4>Web App</h4>



<p>Users whose interest is piqued would then try the app. Rather than requiring an initial commitment by downloading a full app, we created a progressive web app. Here, the user would engage in a “this-or-that” quiz, which helps to define their arts experience.</p>



<p>After completion, of the quiz, users can choose to see portions of their experience, or keep it a mystery, before committing to purchase. Before an experience is revealed, users can read a blurb about why Spectacles curator matched them to this particular event, and why it would be a good choice.Users may reveal up to two aspects of their experience; one remains a mystery!</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4>A seamless experience</h4>



<p>As the app builds the experience, a code that acts as a singular ticket and payment method connects the user seamlessly to each aspect of their experience. Front-of-house staff at each venue and restaurant scan the code with their version of the Spectacle app.</p>
</div></div>

</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4>Invitation</h4>



<p>If the experience is a gift, or perhaps if the user would like a more luxurious experience, they can opt to have a physical invitation sent to them. This invitation features the scannable code present in the app.</p>

<h2>Our Process</h2>



<h3>Brainstorming</h3>



<p>The prompt for this project was free-form, the only constraint being that it had to involve music as a service. Once we assembled as a group, we immediately began a conversation about music, the many ways it affects our lives and the lives of others. </p>



<p>The conversation naturally came to a convergence around culture. We began a narrative around music as roots and as seeds; music allows us to reconnect with our cultural roots, and to plant new cultural seeds in the discovery of new music.</p>



<p>Then, we started a conversation about how this could evolve into a service, and saw an opportunity in music institutions with clear cultural value, yet were struggling to connect with new audiences, such as jazz, opera, and the symphony. </p>



<p>We decided to initially focus on opera for our research because it’s an outwardly polarizing genre, and would generate an array of perspectives.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>Defining Stakeholders</h3>



<p>We thought about all the stakeholders such a service could impact, and found that it could extend beyond the opera company and its patrons. We decided to conduct research with a few key stakeholders to help set the direction our service would take.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group box boxr"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>Survey</h3>



<p>We sent the survey to our inner circles and the college community to gather perspective on how young people view opera. Immediately a trend was clear: <strong>Those who haven’t seen opera tend to be wary of it, and those who have tend to enjoy it and become repeat viewers.</strong></p>



<p>Respondents highlighted the preconceptions that prevented them from pursuing an opera experience on their own:</p>



<p>High perceived cost. Although many opera companies offer heavily discounted tickets, especially for students, the idea that seeing an opera would be costly (and require formal attire) persists.</p>



<p>Lack of interest in subject matter. Young audiences tend to see opera as unrelatable–despite the breadth of subject matter the genre traverses, the consistent outward image is of an older, ornate, European artform. The more innovative productions are not being sold well to new audiences.</p>



<p>Among those who have seen opera, we found that most were invited to their first by a friend or family member. Here we saw an opportunity: how could a service act as the friend that encouraged that first leap into seeing something new?</p>

<h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong>“If we are not creating programming that resonates with the general public then we have failed. We have to be cognizant about what is actually going on in the community around us.”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>We scheduled interviews with engagement teams and other members of the opera and arts communities, operating from a local to a global scale. Their responses validated some of our initial assumptions.</p>



<p>We learned that <strong>engagement is a persistent challenge</strong> across organizations, and that there really isn’t a silver bullet for solving it. Common efforts include cross-advertising with other arts institutions, offering discounts at nearby restaurants, and inviting schools to watch educational performances. At larger institutions with more room to experiment, there is an even broader range of engagement initiatives, including developing pocket operas for those in hospice care and babies!</p>



<p>Another complicated challenge for arts organizations is <strong>gathering feedback from audiences</strong>. Currently, their efforts are typically piecemeal, ranging from ticket sale observations, surveys included in newsletters, social media engagement, and simple word-of-mouth. </p>



<p>Based on these conversations, we saw a need for approaching engagement holistically, thinking of it as extending before and after the performance, and allowing for a reliable, continuing dialogue between audiences and the institutions that serve them. Additionally, we expanded our service to include arts organizations beyond opera, as they not only often work in tandem, but opera seasons are typically too short to support a standalone service.</p>

<p>We tested these ideas on our classmates to see which would resonate with them the most. </p>

<h3>Concept Definition</h3>



<h4>VISUAL LANGUAGE</h4>



<p>We saw the visual and verbal tone of the app as crucial to ensuring new audiences would be open to engaging. Our dialogue often centered around what should be introduced when, with regard to revealing the performance, payment, and ratings. Should any of these three elements be too forceful or unnatural, the service would fail.</p>



<p>For this reason, we started defining the look and feel rather early so that potential users could react.</p>

<h4><strong>Blueprint building</strong></h4>



<p>Throughout the process, we were encouraged to treat our service blueprint as a living document.</p>

<h3>Concept Evaluation</h3>



<p>The users we tested with represented extremes among potential Spectacle users; we spoke with one user who seemed very reluctant to try new things, and one who was eager to, but also wanted a sense of luxury and value. Our ideal user sits somewhere between these two: those who might try a new arts experience if coordination were a little easier.<br><br></p>

<h3>Prototyping</h3>



<p>Going through multiple rounds of fidelity helped us to refine the app as we went.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>



<h3>What was helpful</h3>



<p>Our conversations with people making engagement efforts across different types of institutions was essential to the success of this project. Their range of perspectives allowed us to have a strong idea of what was possible and what was ideal.</p>



<h3>What had the most potential</h3>



<p>We honestly think that, if set in the right tone and equipped with the right curator (human or algorithmic), this idea would bring people into contact with new art forms.</p>



<h3>The main takeaways</h3>



<p>This service won’t be for everyone. It’s unrealistic to expect everyone to suddenly enjoy the cultural arts thanks to a service, but by situating our initial touchpoint in festivals where new potential audiences already are, we stand a strong chance of connecting them.</p>



<h3>Given more time…</h3>



<p>As is often the case with educational projects, there was little time to test. We’d like to try a more robust version of the service with users, and present it to arts organizations!</p>
